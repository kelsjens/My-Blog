Python is one of the best tools for working with data, but to really make the most of it, you need the right libraries. Three must-haves in any data scientist’s toolbox are pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. These libraries make it easy to clean and analyze data, run fast numerical calculations, and create visualizations that actually make sense. Whether you're sorting through messy datasets, crunching numbers, or bringing data to life with charts, these tools have you covered. In this post, we’ll break down what they do, why they’re useful, and how you can start using them right away. Lets get to it!

## Pandas: A data analyzation and manipulation library
Pandas is one of the most widely used python libraries for handling data. It helps you read, explore, clean, and transform datasets with simple, efficient functions.
# Reading in data
The First step is always reading data in. Pandas makes this easy:

# Data Exploration 
We can look into what the data is talking about through the use of functions such as...
df.head() which gives us the top rows of a given dataset to look at. 
df.discribe which is a summary of the data we give it. 
# Data cleaning and manipulation
