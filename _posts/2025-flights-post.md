## _Introduction_
How many of us have had our flights delayed in an airport? Is there anything more frustrating than wanting to go on an amazing trip and when you're about to leave your flight is delayed 1, 2, or maybe even 24 hours? In this post we will explore what airlines lead to the largest average time of delayed flights, what percentage of flights are delayed based on the airline, and we will explore what days of the week cause the most delayed flights. All of this data will be based on the month of May at the SLC airport in 2024. Lets find out some easier stress free ways to travel!

# _Airline Priority_ 
Some of us greatly value a dependable airline that is going to take off at the right time which in turn gets us to our destination at the right time. This is greatly important to those that have small layovers or schedules to keep. Not all airlines are the same when it comes to how often or how long they are delayed. If you are looking for an airline with the smallest percentage of delayed flights and shortest delays it would be wise to avoid Hawaiian airlines. If you want reliability then your best bet is definitely Alaskan or Delta. 
The chart below shows the average time of delay of a given airline. 


The following chart shows what percentage of flights are delayed by each airline by 25 minutes or more.
