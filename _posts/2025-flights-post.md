## Introduction 
How many of us have had our flights delayed in an airport? Is there anything more frustrating than wanting to go on an amazing trip and when you're about to leave your flight is delayed 1, 2, or maybe even 24 hours? In this post we will explore what airlines lead to the largest average time of delayed flights, what percentage of flights are delayed based on the airline, and we will explore what days of the week cause the most delayed flights. All of this data will be based on the month of May at the SLC airport in 2024. Lets find out some easier stress free ways to travel!
