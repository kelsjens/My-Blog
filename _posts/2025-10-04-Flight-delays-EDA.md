# _Introduction_ 
In my previous post, we dug into the frustration of flight delays at Salt Lake City International Airport (SLC). Now, we’ll take a closer look at which airlines and which days of the week are the most—and least—reliable. After highlighting a few key findings, I’ll introduce an interactive dashboard so you can explore delay patterns on your own and plan your next trip with confidence.

## _Question_ 
Which airlines and days of the week have the worst delays, and how long are those delays on average?

# _Key Insights_ 
We’re going to quickly highlight a few simple but helpful findings from the data before you dive into the interactive dashboard.

One of the main questions we asked was: Which airline tends to have the worst delays—and which one performs best?
This graph below makes that pretty clear:

As you can see, Hawaiian Airlines stands out with the longest average delay time by a wide margin.

Before I give away too many insights, I’ll stop here and let you explore the rest for yourself through the Streamlit app I built. Think of this as a teaser to get your brain warmed up and ready to find the travel patterns that matter most to you.
